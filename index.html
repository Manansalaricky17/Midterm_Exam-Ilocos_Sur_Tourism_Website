        <h2>About Ilocos Sur</h2>
        <p>Ilocos Sur was founded by the Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo in 1572. It was formed when the north (now Ilocos Norte) split from the south (Ilocos Sur). At that time, it included parts of Abra and the upper half of present-day La Uni√≥n. The current boundary of the province was permanently defined through Act 2683 signed in March 1917.</p>
